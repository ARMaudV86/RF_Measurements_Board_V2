# RF_Measurements_Board_V2

A simple yet very useful tool to test the effects/characteristics of components with a VNA.
The board allows testing of S11 & S21 in the folowing configuration :

  * Through calibration of the test setup
  * Components in serie/shunt configuration
  * Components in shunt configuration
  * Components in shunt configuration with DC bias apply (the test rig can be isolated of the DC thanks to two series capacitors)
